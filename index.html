    <h2>MY STORY</h2>
    <p>I didn’t start my fashion journey with luxury or unlimited resources. There were no fancy studios or endless fabric rolls—just a deep love for design and an unshakable belief that clothing could be more than just fabric stitched together. I saw fashion as a way to tell stories, boost confidence, and make every woman feel like the best version of herself.

        I started small—sketching ideas, learning the craft, and figuring things out one stitch at a time. There were days when things didn’t turn out as planned, nights spent reworking designs, and moments of doubt. But through it all, my passion kept me going. I knew that women deserved clothes that weren’t just stylish but also practical, versatile, and made to fit real lives—not just fashion runways.
        
        That’s how Tiwatope Clothes was born. A brand that brings you chic, comfortable, and confidence-boosting fashion, whether custom-made or ready-to-wear. Every piece is designed with love, keeping you—the modern woman—in mind.
        
        This isn’t just about fashion. It’s about wearing confidence, embracing individuality, and redefining elegance in your own way. And I’m so excited to have you on this journey with me.
